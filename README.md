cvc4-ocaml
==========

OCaml bindings for CVC4.

The bindings only deal with the QF_EUF theory, but all building blocks should be there to extend it to others. 

Set the correct paths to the CVC4 libraries and include files in the Makefile.

To build the library do ```make```, to build an example file, do ```make cvc4_test``` and generate some documentation with ```make doc```.
